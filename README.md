## What is Dedicated Cortex Instance?

A Dedicated Cortex Instance is a deployment strategy for CognitiveScale's Cortex platform. The Cortex platform can be deployed two major ways: on the SaaS Cloud, the original deployment strategy or as a Dedicated Instance, the newest deployment option. The table below highlights the differences between the two deployment methods.

|  | **Cortex Cloud** | **Dedicated Cortex Instance** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Description** | CognitiveScale’s original Cortex deployment, a multi-tenant, CS-managed cloud solution. | CognitiveScale’s new Cortex deployment, a private-cloud, client-managed  solution. |
| **Who manages the cloud/stack?** | CognitiveScale | Client |
| **Where is the stack managed?** | CognitiveScale's Cloud | Client's Azure Cloud (Kubernetes)|
| **What are the advantages of this deployment?** | CognitiveScale manages and monitors stack activity, updates, and infrastructure. Edge add-on option provides data-secure processing. | Clients manage their own individual deployments. Their data is not exposed to CognitiveScale, even indirectly. |

## Azure and Dedicated Cortex Instance architecture

After the prerequisite steps are completed, the client configures their stack in Azure Marketplace, deploys it, and verifies the deployment by logging in to their Kubernetes dashboard.  Your CognitiveScale CS1 and SRE representatives provide assistance and direction throughout the deployment process.

Your Dedicated Cortex Instance is configured as follows:

  - **Subscription**: Create a pay-as-you-go Azure Marketplace subscription (prerequisite)
   - **Main Resource Group**: Within your subscription you must have a main Resource Group (prerequisite) - NOTE: This Resource Group must be NEW with no existing resources. 
    - **Main DNS Zone**: Within your main resource group you must configure your main DNS Zone (prerequisite)
     - **DCI Resource Group**: In the DCI Create setup you must create a NEW empty resource group for your DCI deployment. 
      - **DCI DNS Zone** (subdomain): Within the DCI Resource Group you must create a DNS subdomain that references the Main DNS Zone. Your URLs and access to Cortex tools and UIs are based on this DNS Zone-Base Domain

### Before you begin working in Azure:

- Create DNS domain at domain registrar like Google, GoDaddy, Name Cheap, or Route 53. You will need this to create the main DNS Zone. (BASE DOMAIN)
- Verify that you have the following CLI utilities installed: (On Mac use homebrew installer to install the utilities: `brew tap derailed/k9s && brew install kubectl azure-cli jq k9s`)

  - kubectl
  - azure-cli
  - jq
  - k9s

### Azure permissions required to perform an installation

To complete the Dedicated Cortex Instance deployment you must have the abiltiy to perform the following actions in Azure:

  - Create a subscription
  - Create Resource Groups
  - Create DNS Zones
  - View Azure logs
  - Create a subdomain NS record
  - Manage (create, delete, and edit) DNS record sets

### Deployment details  

You will require the following details to complete the instantiation process:

  - Subscription: (created by user as part of the prerequisites process)
  - Resource Group (main): (created as part of the prerequisites process)
  - DNS Zone (main): (created as part of the prerequisite process)
  - Location: (centralUS)  
  - Cortex Lisence Key: (provided by CognitiveScale in welcome email)
  - Cortex Cluster Name: (user created)
  - VM SSH Public Key: (user generated) 
  - Resource Group (subordinate): (created as part of the create cluster process) 
  - DNS Zone (subordinate): (created as part of the create cluster process)
  - Azure AD Service Principal ID and password (created as part of the prerequisites process)
  - Cortex Administrator: Email Address (provided by user)
  - Cortex Administrator: Password (created by user)
  - Cortex Account Name: (created by user) 
  - Cortex Administrator phone number: (provided by user)

### Prerequisite Steps

Before you begin you must have a registered Internet domain name (e.g. example.com) with a domain name registrar (e.g. AWS, godaddy.com, name.com, etc.). This will be used to configure your main DNS Zone (BASE DOMAIN).


1. Learn about Azure: [Getting Started with Azure][b6d1b728].
2. Go to Azure Marketplace and create a [subscription][subscription-help] - Select a "Pay" Azure subscription or use your existing Azure subscription.
3. Get started in the Azure portal:

   - a. [Launch the Azure CLI][azure-cli]. 
   - b. Select your subscription and opt to create storage account.
   - c. Select to run `-bash` (or `-powershell` Instructions for Powershell users can be found in MS Azure help.
   - d. When the terminal opens, list your subscriptions: `az account list`.
   - e. Set your subscription for future sessions: `az account set --subscription my-subscription-name`.

4. Create your main Resource Group - [Use the Azure CLI to Create a Resource Group][resource-group-cli]. 
  
  **Create the Resource Group using Azure CLI**: 
  
   `az group create --location
                  --name
                  [--subscription]
                  [--tags]`
          
   Where the parameters are as follows:
   `--location -l Location.` 
   Values from: az account list-locations. You can configure the default location using az configure --defaults location=<location>.

  `--name --resource-group -g -n`
    Name of the new resource group.

  Optional Parameters
  `--subscription`
  Name or ID of subscription. You can configure the default subscription using az account set -s NAME_OR_ID.

  `--tags`
  Space-separated tags in 'key[=value]' format. Use "" to clear existing tags.
  
  - OR -
  
  **Create the Resource Group in the Azure UI**:
  
  - a. Click **Resource Group** in the left panel.
  - b. Click **Add** in the tool bar above the table.
  - c. In the form select your Subscription, enter your main Resource Group name, and select the "CentralUS" region.
  - d. Click **Review and Create** at the bottom of the page.
  - e. Click **Create** at the bottom of the page.
  
5. Under this Resource Group create your main DNS zone (Domain). [Create your main DNS Zone][dns-getting-started] ([More information about DNS Zones in Azure][dns-faq]
  - a. Click **Create Resource** at the top of the left panel and enter "DNS Zone" in the search bar.
  - b. Select **DNS Zone** from the list and click **Create**.
  - c. In the form enter the following:

   - **Subscription**: Your subscription should be pre-selected. If it is not, select it.
   - **Resource group**: Click **Create New** and enter the name of the Resource Group you created above.
    - **Instance Details: Name**: Enter your registered Internet domain name as the DNS Zone name.
    
  - d. Click **Review and Create** at the bottom of the page.
  - e. Click **Create** at the bottom of the page.

**NOTE**: Later, when you create your Dedicated Cortex instance you will create another Resource Group and DNS Zone; these will be specifically for your Cortex Instantiation. The Resource Group and DNS Zone that your create as prerequisites will be referenced in the Dedicated Cortex Instantiation setup.

6. Remove AZ vCPU limits in Azure: See [Resource Manager vCPU quota increase requests][vCPU-quota-requests]. 
7. [Setup your Azure AD Service Principal][service principal]. 
 
  **For bash users**: 
 
  Run the following script. You will be prompted to select the subscription. Be sure to copy the output to a text file. You   will enter the values later as AD Service Principal App ID and password.

2. Click your group and wait for "provision" to be displayed.
3. Click "provision" in the list.
4. Click "Containers" in the near left panel. An the top left monitor the "Number of Restarts". You will need to click _Refresh_ periodically to monitor this. 

If your deployment has >5 restarts, it is likely to fail. You should abort the process, return to the Resource Groups list, find the groups associated with the your Resource Group and delete them. (Click the three dots on the far right to expose the Delete function.)

Additionally, you can monitor the provisioning logs after the "provision" item has been created in your Resource Group container. 
To monitor the logs, either click the **Logs** link in the Azure UI on the PROVISION page. You need to scroll to follow the progress of the logs

When your deployment is completely provisioned, a list of the URL logins and other account details are listed in the logs display. Copy this information to a text editor and save it where you can access it later.

## Determine your Base Domain

Your BASE DOMAIN is the DNS Zone. 

1. Go to your Azure portal. 
2. Navigate to your Resource Group from the left panel. 
3. The DNS zone/BASE DOMAIN is displayed.
4. Use the base domain and the following URLs to access Cortex tools and interfaces:

  - **Cortex Admin Console**: https://console.<base_domain>
  - **Cortex Studio Connection Url**: https://api.<base_domain>
  - **Cortex Private registry**: private-registry.<base_domain>
  - **CognitiveScale Marketplace**: https://marketplace.<base_domain>
  - **Cortex CLI**: https://api.<base_domain>
  
  NOTE: The URLs for the above Cortex tools are displayed in the output of the provision logs.
  
## Set up ./kube/config to view cluster through Kubernetes dashboard

1. Login to Azure in your terminal `az login` (a web  browser opens where you select your subscription)
2. Run the following command to update your `~/.kube/config` file with your azure credentials: `az aks get-credentials --resource-group <ResourceGroupName>centralus --name aks_cluster_backend --admin` (The only variable you replace in this script is the ResourceGroupName
3. Run the following command to gain access to the Kubernetes dashboard: `kubectl create clusterrolebinding kubernetes-dashboard -n kube-system --clusterrole=cluster-admin --serviceaccount=kube-system:kubernetes-dashboard' 
4. Run the following command to start the proxy for the Kubernetes dashboard: `Kubectl proxy --port=9090`

  The Kubernetes dashboard can then be reached from this URL: http://localhost:9090/api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/services/kubernetes-dashboard/proxy/#!/overview?namespace=default

5. After you open the Kubernetes dashboard you must set the Namespace (open it from the left panel) to "All Namespaces".

## Debugging WAF issues

1. Login to the Azure `az login`.
2. Open your Kubernetes dashboard using the link above. 
3. Verify that you have selected "All Namespaces."
3. Run the following: `kubectl exec -it $(kubectl get pods --all-namespaces | grep nginx-ingress-controller | awk '{print $2}') -- /bin/bash`
4. Find your log located here: `/var/log/modsec_audit.log`

If the SMTP is set up with Google:

**NOTE**: [How to set up an SMTP server in Azure][setup-smtp-server]. 

1. [Enable less secure apps][lesssecureapps]
2. [Disable Captcha temporarily so you can connect the new device/server][disablecaptcha]
3. Add the following 3 environment variables to your accounts deployment: 

 - SMTP_FROM
 - SMTP_EMAIL
 - SMTP_FROM_PSWD 

This will cause the accounts pod to recycle, which is expected.

## Upgrade your DCI cluster

**WARNING**: Upgrades should be performed during a scheduled downtime. If the upgrade process fails, the cluster reverts to a pre-upgrade snapshot, in which case data loss may occur if processes are running during the upgrade. 

A galaxy admin performs the upgrade from the bastion server. 

1. SSH into the bastion host `azureuser@<bastion-host-ip>`
2. Authenticate with the public SSH key entered during provisioning.  

  **NOTE**: The `bastion-host-ip`0000 is available under the primary resource group used to deploy the environment, under object name `bastion-nic`.

3. Execute `./upgrade_cortex.sh`

  To upgrade to a specific version you may add the `-v <version #>` variable.(`./upgrade_cortex.sh -v 1.1.0`)
